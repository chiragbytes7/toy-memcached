A C++ toy memcached-style implementation that follows a single listener (acceptor) thread and multiple worker threads model to support concurrent access for a large number of clients. A very basic scheduler assigns newly accepted client socket file descriptors from the listener to worker threads via FD handoff. Each worker thread runs its own epoll-based event loop, allowing many client connections to be handled concurrently without creating a thread per connection
